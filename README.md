# SegmentBasedLagrangeInterpolation

This repository outlines the development of a novel interpolation method that segments data based on trend changes and applies Lagrange polynomial interpolation within each segment. This approach is crafted for its mathematical intuitiveness and computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for large datasets.

## Overview

The Segment-Based Lagrange Interpolation method refines traditional interpolation techniques by segmenting data according to slope changes before applying interpolation. This methodology circumvents the complexities and derivative dependencies of conventional methods, streamlining the process of fitting curves to data. It's particularly adept at capturing data trends accurately, offering a viable solution to common interpolation challenges.

## Key Features

- **Trend-Based Segmentation:** Segments data based on calculated slope changes, ensuring that each segment reflects a distinct data trend for more precise interpolation.
- **Reduced Computational Complexity:** Despite utilizing Lagrange interpolation within segments, the method maintains $O(N)$ computational complexity, offering efficiency in processing large datasets.
- **Mitigation of Runge's Phenomenon:** By interpolating over fewer points within each segment, the method aims to lessen the impact of Runge's phenomenon, a common issue with high-degree polynomial interpolations.

## Results

Illustrated results within this repository demonstrate the method's effectiveness across a variety of datasets. The interpolation not only follows the given $x, y$ values closely (marked as blue points on the graphs) but also smooths over potential data irregularities without overfitting.

## Challenges and Future Directions

While the method introduces significant improvements over traditional interpolation techniques, it's not without its challenges:

- **Vulnerability to Runge's Phenomenon:** Although segmenting data reduces the number of points for each interpolation, the method can still exhibit sensitivity to Runge's phenomenon under certain conditions.
- **Order Sensitivity in Differentiation:** The process of identifying trend changes is sensitive to the computation's directional approach, which can affect the segmentation and, subsequently, the interpolation results.

Future enhancements will focus on refining the segmentation logic to further mitigate these challenges, exploring adaptive curvature adjustments for each segment, and considering alternative interpolation techniques within segments for enhanced flexibility and accuracy.
