# EfficientArcInterpolation

This repository documents the development of an efficient interpolation method designed to connect data points using piecewise arcs. This new method stands out for its simplicity and computational efficiency, making it particularly well-suited for large datasets.

## Overview

The Efficient Arc Interpolation method introduces a novel approach to data visualization and analysis. Unlike traditional interpolation techniques that rely on complex mathematical models and derivative information, this method simplifies the curve-fitting process. It employs a strategy that adjusts the curvature of arcs between data points based on the slopes' relative changes, enabling a quick and intuitive representation of data trends.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity in Design:** The method utilizes fixed curvature values for connecting data points, reducing the need for complex calculations.
- **Efficiency for Large Datasets:** With an $O(N)$ computational complexity, it is notably more efficient for analyzing large datasets compared to traditional methods like Lagrange or cubic splines.
- **No Derivative Data Required:** This interpolation technique does not necessitate derivative data ($y'$, $y''$), streamlining its application to datasets where such information is unavailable or difficult to compute.

## Results

The repository showcases the method's application across various datasets, demonstrating its capability to model data trends effectively. Each figure within the documentation highlights the interpolated results, clearly marking the given $x, y$ values as blue points on the graphs.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its advantages, the method encounters limitations, such as the potential for inaccuracies when fixed curvature values do not align with the data's inherent trends. The documentation explores these challenges in detail, proposing potential extensions to enhance the method's accuracy and applicability. Future improvements could include dynamic curvature adjustments and the exploration of other geometric shapes for a more nuanced data representation.
